### Unsupervised Image Segmentation Using Features Learned from Convolutional Auto-encoder

Some useful features from images have been learned by training a deep convolutional Auto-encoder. We performed feature transform using PCA. Finally, mean shift clustering algorithm was implemented to segment images in an unsupervised way.
